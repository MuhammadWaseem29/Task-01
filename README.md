To enable and use SSH commands, you need to have the OpenSSH server installed and running on your system. Hereâ€™s a general guide to enable SSH commands:

### On Linux

1. **Install OpenSSH Server** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openssh-server
   ```

2. **Start and Enable SSH Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start ssh
   sudo systemctl enable ssh
   ```

3. **Check SSH Service Status**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status ssh
   ```

4. **Configure SSH** (if needed):
   - Edit the SSH configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```
   - Make sure the following line is not commented out (remove `#` if present):
     ```bash
     PermitRootLogin yes
     ```

5. **Restart SSH Service** to apply any changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

6. **Allow SSH Through Firewall** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow ssh
   ```

### On Windows

1. **Install OpenSSH Server** (if not already installed):
   - Open "Settings" -> "Apps" -> "Optional features" -> "Add a feature".
   - Find and install "OpenSSH Server".

2. **Start and Enable SSH Service**:
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator:
     ```powershell
     Start-Service sshd
     Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'
     ```

3. **Check SSH Service Status**:
   ```powershell
   Get-Service sshd
   ```

4. **Configure SSH** (if needed):
   - Edit the SSH configuration file located at:
     ```
     C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config
     ```

5. **Allow SSH Through Firewall**:
   - Open "Windows Defender Firewall" -> "Advanced settings".
   - Create a new inbound rule allowing TCP port 22.

Once SSH is enabled and configured, you can use SSH commands to connect to other machines. For example, to connect to a remote server, use:
```bash
ssh username@hostname_or_ip
```

Feel free to ask if you need help with any specific SSH commands or configurations!
